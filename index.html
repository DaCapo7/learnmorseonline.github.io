          /><b>Morse code</b> was invented by an American called
          <b>Samuel Finley Breese Morse, (1791-1872)</b>. He was not only an
          inventor but also a famous painter. Before the invention of the
          telegraph, most messages that had to be sent over long distances were
          carried by<b>
            messengers who memorized them or carried them in writing</b
          >. These messages could be delivered no faster than the fastest horse.
          Messages could also be sent visually, using
          <b>flags and later, mechanical systems called semaphore telegraphs</b
          >, but these systems required the receiver to be close enough to see
          the sender, and could not be used at night.
          <br />
          The<b> telegraph </b>allowed messages to be sent very fast over long
          distances using <b>electricity</b>. The first commercial telegraph was
          developed
          <b>by William Forthergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone in 1837</b>.
          They developed a device which could send messages using electrical
          signals to line up compass needles on a grid containing letters of the
          alphabet. Then, in
          <b>1838, Samuel Morse and his assistant, Alfred Vail,</b> demonstrated
          an even more successful telegraph device which sent messages using a
          special code - <b>Morse code.</b>
          <br />
          Telegraph messages were sent by tapping out the code for each letter
          in the form of long and short signals. <b>Short signals</b> are
          referred to as <i>dits</i> (represented as dots).
          <b>Long signals</b> are referred to as <i>dahs</i> (represented as
          dashes). The code was converted into electrical impulses and sent over
          telegraph wires. A telegraph receiver on the other end of the wire
          converted the impulses back into to dots and dashes, and decoded the
          message. In 1844, Morse demonstrated the telegraph to the United
          States Congress using a now famous message
          <i>"What hath God wrought"</i>.

          Morse's original code was not quite the same as the one in use today
          as it included <b>pauses</b> as well as dahs and dits. However, a
          conference <b>in Berlin in 1851 </b>established an
          <b>international version</b>, which is shown below:

          The most well-known signal sent using Morse Code is:<br />
          <button id="easteregg"><b>. . . - - - . . .</b></button><br />
          and is the distress signal <b>SOS</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morse code requires the time between dits and dahs, between letters,
          and between words to be as accurate as possible. A <i>Dit</i> takes -
          <b>1 unit of time</b> A <i>Dah</i> takes - <b>3 units of time</b> The
          <b>pause between Dits/Dahs</b> - <b>1 unit of time</b> The
          <b>pause between letters</b> - <b>3 units of time</b> The
          <b>pause between words</b> - <b>7 units of time</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The speed at which a message is sent in Morse code is normally given
          in <b>words per minute (WPM)</b>. The word <b>"Paris"</b> (including
          the space after it) is used as the length of a standard word.
          <i>How long does this take?</i> (Answer is given at the end of the
          article). An experienced Morse code operator can send and receive
          messages at a rate of <b>20-30 WPM.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of Morse's aims was to keep the code as short as possible, which
          meant the <b>commonest letters should have the shortest codes</b>.
          Morse came up with a marvellous idea. He went to his local newspaper.
          In those days
          <b
            >printers made their papers by putting together individual letters
            (type) into a block</b
          >, then covering the block with ink and pressing paper on the top. The
          printers kept the letters (type) in cases with each letter kept in a
          separate compartment. Of course, they had many more of some letters
          than others because they knew they needed more when they created a
          page of print. Morse simply counted the number of pieces of type for
          each letter. He found that there were more e's than any other letter
          and so he gave <b>'e' the shortest code, 'dit'</b>. This explains why
          there appears to be no obvious relationship between alphabetical order
          and the symbols used.

          <b>Answer:</b><br />
          <i
            >Paris = 50&nbsp;time units (43 for the letters plus 7&nbsp;for the
            space after the word).</i
          >
